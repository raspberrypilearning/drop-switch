To craft a drop switch for your Raspberry Pi Pico, you will need:

+ A Raspberry Pi Pico
+ 2 x socket-pin jumper wires
+ Sticky tape
+ Kitchen foil or conductive tape

**Instructions**

1. Create two conductive strips either with kitchen foil or conductive tape. 
2. Stick the pin ends of the jumper wire to each strip.

3. Stick some kitchen foil or conductive tape to the bottom of an object. The base must be large enough to create a connection between the two wires.

4. Attach the socket ends of the jumper wires to your Raspberry Pi Pico and drop your switch!
